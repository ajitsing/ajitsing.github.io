This problem has troubled me a lot before I found the solution to it. And no forum provided the right solution for it, hence this post. You can go through the [rvm issue thread](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/issues/210){:target="_blank"} for more details about the issue.

# Why this occurs?

This problem occurs when you have multiple active rvm sessions in the same terminal.

# Solution

Simple solution to this problem is update your rvm version such that [this pull request](https://github.com/rvm/rvm/pull/3627){:target="_blank"} is present in that version or just point your rvm to the latest head. Run the below command and **it will solve your problem**.

```bash
rvm get head
```

# Other potential solutions which might or might not work

createÂ ```~/.direnvrc``` with the below content

```bash
# Circumvent https://github.com/direnv/direnv/issues/210
#
shell_session_update() { :; }
```

### get stable<br><br>

```bash
rvm get stable
```

### Initialize rvm only once

If you have below line in multiple files like ```~/.profile``` or ```~/.bash_profile``` or ```~/.bashrc```, please keep this line in only one of the files so that it gets initialized only once.

```bash
source $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin

or

[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin"
```
