## üè¢ **Nvidia's Revenue Concentration Problem**

This week's earnings revealed something that should worry both Nvidia and the broader AI ecosystem: just two customers account for 39% of their revenue. While Nvidia won't name them, industry watchers suspect they're likely Microsoft and Meta, given their massive AI infrastructure investments.

**Why this matters for developers:**
- **Supply chain risk**: If these customers reduce orders, it could impact chip availability
- **Pricing power**: Heavy concentration gives large customers more negotiating leverage
- **Competition concerns**: Smaller AI companies might struggle to get priority access to the latest chips

The revelation highlights how the AI boom has created winner-take-all dynamics that could shape the entire industry's future.

### Meta's Scale AI Breakup

The partnership between Meta and Scale AI, once held up as a model for AI data collaboration, is showing serious strain. Sources report disagreements over data quality, pricing, and strategic direction.

**What's happening:**
- Scale AI was supposed to help Meta label and clean training data
- Quality issues and missed deadlines have frustrated Meta's AI teams  
- Both companies are reportedly exploring other partnerships

This matters because it shows how hard it is to scale AI data operations, even with dedicated companies focused on the problem. If Meta and Scale can't make it work smoothly, what does that say about smaller companies trying to build their own AI systems?

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

### WhatsApp's Zero-Click Nightmare

WhatsApp fixed a critical vulnerability that allowed attackers to install spyware on Apple devices without any user interaction. The bug was actively exploited in the wild, targeting journalists and activists.

**Technical details:**
- Attackers could send malicious media files that triggered the exploit
- No user interaction required - just receiving the message was enough
- Affected iOS devices running specific WhatsApp versions
- Patch rolled out automatically to most users

### TransUnion Data Breach Hits 4.4M Users

The credit reporting agency confirmed hackers stole personal information from 4.4 million customers. The breach included names, addresses, phone numbers, and partial credit information.

### FBI: China's Salt Typhoon Compromised 200+ US Companies

The FBI revealed that Chinese hackers have infiltrated at least 200 US companies using sophisticated supply chain attacks. The campaign targeted software vendors to gain access to their customers' networks.

This reinforces why supply chain security should be a top priority for any company. Trust but verify applies to every dependency in your stack.
