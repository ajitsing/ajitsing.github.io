## üí∞ The Stripe Tempo Blockchain Bombshell

Payment giant Stripe dropped the biggest fintech news of the year by unveiling Tempo, their own payments-first blockchain built specifically for stablecoins and real-world payments. This isn't just another crypto experiment - it's a serious infrastructure play.

**What makes Tempo different:**
- **Speed**: 100K+ transactions per second with sub-second finality
- **Flexibility**: Pay gas fees in any stablecoin via enshrined AMM
- **Partners**: Deutsche Bank, OpenAI, Shopify, Visa, DoorDash, and more
- **Purpose-built**: Designed for payments, not speculative trading

The blockchain targets real-world use cases like global payroll, remittances, and "agentic payments" for AI systems. For developers, this could be the infrastructure that finally makes crypto payments practical for mainstream applications.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Google Faces Another $3.5B Reality Check

The European Union hit Google with yet another massive fine - $3.5 billion for abusing its dominance in the ad tech market. This brings Google's total EU fines to over $10 billion, showing regulators aren't backing down from Big Tech enforcement.

**Why this matters for developers:**
- **Platform policies**: Expect stricter rules around data collection and ad targeting
- **API changes**: Google may limit access to certain advertising APIs
- **Competition**: Opens opportunities for alternative ad tech solutions

The fine specifically targets Google's practice of favoring its own advertising services while squeezing out competitors. For developers building ad-supported applications, this could mean more diverse monetization options as the market becomes more competitive.

## üíæ Microsoft's Nostalgic Open Source Gift

Microsoft released something special this week: the original source code for Bill Gates' 6502 BASIC interpreter from 1978. This is the code that powered early home computers like the Apple II and Commodore PET, teaching millions their first programming lessons.

**What's included:**
- Original 6502 assembly code
- Historical documentation and context  
- MIT license for modern use and study
- Insights into early Microsoft development practices

**Why it matters today:**
- Educational value for understanding computing fundamentals
- Shows how simple tools can have massive impact
- Great example of preserving computing history
- Demonstrates the evolution of programming languages

The release comes as part of Microsoft's broader open source initiatives and partnership with the Computer History Museum. For developers interested in retro computing or language design, this is a fascinating glimpse into the foundations of modern programming.

## üéÆ Gaming Infrastructure Meets Its Match

Hollow Knight: Silksong finally launched after years of delays - and promptly broke the internet. The overwhelming demand crashed Steam, Nintendo eShop, and multiple gaming platforms simultaneously.

**The infrastructure carnage:**
- Steam struggled with unprecedented concurrent downloads
- Nintendo eShop went down for several hours  
- PlayStation Store experienced intermittent outages
- Gaming news sites crashed under traffic loads

This is a perfect case study in handling viral demand and the importance of building systems that can scale beyond normal peak loads.
