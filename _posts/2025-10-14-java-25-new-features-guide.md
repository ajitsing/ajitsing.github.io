September 2025. After three years of waiting, Java finally released its next Long-Term Support (LTS) version. The last one was Java 21 in September 2023. If you've been holding off on upgrading, this is the release you've been waiting for.

From simplified syntax that makes "Hello World" actually simple to performance improvements that can reduce your infrastructure costs, Java 25 packs features that matter. Let's dive into the changes that will actually impact your daily work.

---

## Change 1: Simplified Main Methods (JEP 512)

**What Changed:**

Remember writing this for every Hello World?

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

Now you write this:

```java
void main() {
    println("Hello World");
}
```

That's it. No class. No `public static`. No `String[] args`. Just your code.

**Code Example:**

```java
// Old way - 5 lines of boilerplate
public class Calculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(2 + 2);
    }
}

// New way - Pure logic
void main() {
    println(2 + 2);
}
```

You can still use `String[] args` if you need command-line arguments:

```java
void main(String[] args) {
    println("Hello, " + args[0]);
}
```

**What It Means:**

Java is finally competing with Python and Go for "getting started" simplicity. Your `main()` method is now just a function, not a ceremony.

---

## Change 2: Flexible Constructor Bodies (JEP 513)

**What Changed:**

For 30 years, you couldn't do anything before calling `super()` or `this()` in a constructor. This caused endless workarounds.

```java
// Before: Impossible to validate before super()
class User extends Person {
    User(String name) {
        if (name == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException(); // COMPILE ERROR!
        super(name); // Must be first
    }
}
```

Now you can:

```java
// After: Validation before super()
class User extends Person {
    User(String name) {
        if (name == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Name cannot be null");
        }
        if (name.isBlank()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Name cannot be blank");
        }
        super(name.trim());
    }
}
```

**What It Means:**

You can finally write constructors that make sense. No more awkward factory methods or static helpers just to validate inputs.

---

## Change 3: Scoped Values - Better Than ThreadLocal

**What Changed:**

`ThreadLocal` has been the standard for 25 years, but it's always been problematic:
- You forget to call `remove()` â†’ memory leaks
- Values leak across thread pool tasks
- Mutable by default (anyone can change your "context")
- Inheritance is manual and error-prone

Scoped Values solve all of this:

```java
// Old way with ThreadLocal
private static final ThreadLocal<User> currentUser = new ThreadLocal<>();

void processRequest(User user) {
    currentUser.set(user);
    try {
        doWork();
    } finally {
        currentUser.remove(); // MUST remember this or leak memory
    }
}

// New way with Scoped Values
private static final ScopedValue<User> CURRENT_USER = ScopedValue.newInstance();

void processRequest(User user) {
    ScopedValue.where(CURRENT_USER, user)
               .run(() -> doWork());
    // Automatically cleaned up. No leaks. Ever.
}
```

**Performance Benefits:**

According to [Oracle's benchmarks](https://openjdk.org/jeps/464), Scoped Values are significantly faster than ThreadLocal:

- **ThreadLocal**: ~17 ns per access
- **Scoped Value**: ~1 ns per access
- **17x faster** in typical scenarios

**What It Means:**

Scoped Values are what ThreadLocal should have been from day one. They're faster, safer, and impossible to leak. This is the biggest quality-of-life improvement in Java 25.

## Change 4: Compact Object Headers - 20% Memory Savings

**What Changed:**

Every object in Java has an "object header" - metadata the JVM uses for garbage collection, synchronization, and identity. This header used to be 128 bits (16 bytes). Now it's 64 bits (8 bytes).

**Before:**
```
Object header: 128 bits
Your data: X bits
Total size: 128 + X bits
```

**After:**
```
Object header: 64 bits
Your data: X bits
Total size: 64 + X bits
```

**Real-World Impact:**

Let's say you have a simple `Point` class:

```java
class Point {
    int x;  // 4 bytes
    int y;  // 4 bytes
}
```

**Java 21:**
- Header: 16 bytes
- Data: 8 bytes
- Padding: 0 bytes
- **Total: 24 bytes per Point**

**Java 25:**
- Header: 8 bytes
- Data: 8 bytes
- **Total: 16 bytes per Point**

That's **33% smaller**. Now imagine you have 10 million Points in memory:

- **Java 21**: 240 MB
- **Java 25**: 160 MB
- **Savings**: 80 MB (33% less memory)

## Change 5: Module Import Declarations - Cleaner Imports

**What Changed:**

Instead of importing individual classes, you can now import entire modules:

```java
// Before: Import each class individually
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import java.net.http.HttpHeaders;
import java.time.Duration;

// After: Import the entire module
import module java.net.http;

public class ApiClient {
    void makeRequest() {
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
            .uri(URI.create("https://api.example.com"))
            .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
            .build();
        
        HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, 
            HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
    }
}
```

**What It Means:**

Your import statements just got cleaner. This is especially useful when working with Java's newer APIs that span multiple related classes.

## Change 6: Key Derivation Function API (KDF) - Security Made Easy

**What Changed:**

Deriving encryption keys from passwords used to require external libraries (Bouncy Castle, Spring Security). Now it's built into the JDK.

**Code Example:**

```java
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;
import java.security.SecureRandom;
import java.util.Base64;

public class PasswordSecurity {
    public static String hashPassword(String password) throws Exception {
        // Generate salt
        byte[] salt = new byte[16];
        new SecureRandom().nextBytes(salt);
        
        // Hash password using PBKDF2
        PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, 65536, 256);
        SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256");
        byte[] hash = factory.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
        
        return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(hash);
    }
}
```

**What It Means:**

You no longer need external security libraries for basic password hashing. The JDK now provides industrial-strength key derivation out of the box.

## Performance Improvements You'll Notice

### 1. Garbage Collection Improvements

The ZGC (Z Garbage Collector) received major upgrades:
- Pause times consistently under 1ms (even with 100GB heaps)
- 15% better throughput compared to Java 21
- Improved handling of large objects

```java
// Same code, better performance
List<String> largeList = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < 10_000_000; i++) {
    largeList.add("Item " + i);
}
// Java 21: ~200ms GC pauses
// Java 25: ~0.5ms GC pauses
```

### 2. Startup Time Reduction

Java 25 applications start 30% faster on average thanks to:
- Improved class loading
- Better JIT compilation
- Optimized standard library initialization

### 3. Lambda and Stream Performance

Lambdas and method references are now 10-20% faster:

```java
// This is now noticeably faster
List<Integer> numbers = IntStream.range(0, 1_000_000)
    .boxed()
    .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
    .map(n -> n * 2)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

## Breaking Changes (What Might Break)

### 1. Finalization Removed

`finalize()` methods have been removed. If you're still using them, switch to:

```java
// Don't use finalize()
class Resource {
    @Override
    protected void finalize() {  // REMOVED in Java 25
        cleanup();
    }
}

// Use try-with-resources or Cleaner API
class Resource implements AutoCloseable {
    private static final Cleaner cleaner = Cleaner.create();
    
    private final Cleaner.Cleanable cleanable;
    
    Resource() {
        this.cleanable = cleaner.register(this, () -> {
            // Cleanup code here
        });
    }
    
    @Override
    public void close() {
        cleanable.clean();
    }
}
```

### 2. Some Deprecated APIs Removed

Check your code for these removed APIs:
- `Thread.stop()` and related thread suspension methods
- Legacy security APIs replaced by the new KDF API
- CORBA-related classes (finally removed after years of deprecation)
