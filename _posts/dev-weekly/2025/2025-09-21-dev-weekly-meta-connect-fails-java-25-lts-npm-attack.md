## 🔥 Top Stories This Week

### Meta's Epic Demo Disasters at Connect 2025 - [🌐](https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-explains-why-connect-2025-keynote-live-demos-failed/)
Meta Connect 2025 (September 17–18) gave us a masterclass in why live demos are hard. Mark Zuckerberg's on‑stage demos failed in front of a packed room and a global stream.

What went wrong:

- **Ray‑Ban Meta Live AI demo** - When chef Jack Mancuso said “Hey Meta, start Live AI” on stage, it triggered every Ray‑Ban Meta glasses in the building
- **Self‑inflicted DDoS** - Live AI traffic had been routed to development servers that got overwhelmed by hundreds of glasses activating at once
- **WhatsApp video call failure** - Zuckerberg couldn't answer incoming calls four times in a row due to a race condition bug

Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later explained the technical details in an Instagram AMA, calling it “a terrible, terrible place for that bug to show up”. Despite the failures, the tech - including the new Ray‑Ban Display glasses with neural band control - worked as intended during private demos.

### Java 25 LTS Released - [🌐](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/09/java25-released/)
Oracle officially released **Java 25 LTS** on September 15th, the first long‑term support release since Java 21. It ships **18 JEPs** with significant performance work.

Key features:

- **Compact Object Headers** - reduces memory usage and improves cache performance
- **Ahead‑of‑Time Method Profiling** - faster startup using data from previous runs
- **Scoped Values** - new thread‑local model designed for virtual threads
- **Module Import Declarations** - makes Java easier for beginners

With 8+ years of support guaranteed, Java 25 is already landing in major IDEs. JetBrains announced IntelliJ IDEA support on September 16th.

### NPM Supply Chain Attack Continues - [🌐](https://www.armorcode.com/blog/inside-the-september-2025-npm-supply-chain-attack)
The sophisticated NPM supply chain attack that began September 8th reached new heights this week. Researchers published more about the **“Shai‑Hulud”** worm that compromised 200+ packages.

Attack details:

- **Phishing** via a fake `npmjs.help` domain registered September 5th
- **200+ packages** compromised, including popular ones like `debug` and `chalk`
- **Cryptocurrency‑theft malware** targeted at browser environments specifically
- **Self‑propagating worm** designed to spread across package dependencies

Multiple security agencies issued advisories this week, with Singapore's CSA publishing alert AD‑2025‑019 on September 17th.
