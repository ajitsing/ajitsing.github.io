Hi, I am Ajit Singh author of singhajit.com. I am an application developer working in one of the MNCs. I started my career in 2012 and got chance to work on different tools and technologies like java, ruby, nodejs, C, javascript, Android etc.

I enjoy working on different technologies, so I decided to start writing this blog to share my experience and learnings.

Thanks for visiting my blog. I am hoping to see you more on singhajit.com. Please participate in discussions and any feedback or suggestions are most welcome.
