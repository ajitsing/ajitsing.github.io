Hi, I'm Ajit Singh, the author of singhajit.com. I'm a software engineer with over a decade of experience, having started my journey in 2012. Over the years, I've worked with Java, Ruby, Node.js, C, JavaScript, Scala, Android and other technologies that keep me busy.

I love working on different tech stacks, which is why I started this blog. I write about what I learn, the problems I solve, and the mistakes I make along the way. It's my way of giving back to the developer community that's helped me so much.

I'm particularly interested in system design, AI, and how we can write better software. There's always something new to learn in this field and I try to share the interesting bits here.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something useful and feel free to join the conversation in the comments.
