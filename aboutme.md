Hi, I am Ajit Singh author of singhajit.com. I am an application developer working in one of the MNCs. I spent 3 years of my career in Chennai (India) and recently I moved to Gurgaon. I have worked on a lot of different technologies and platforms like java, ruby, nodejs, C, javascript, Android etc.

I enjoy working on different technologies, so I decided to start writing this blog which will not be constraint to any single technology but will have multiple technologies.

When it comes to editors my favourite is Vim. I use it a lot. I have written my own vim setup.

Thanks for visiting my blog. I am hoping to see you more on singhajit.com. Please participate in discussions and any feedback or suggestions are most welcome.
